  <h1>Welcome to Maze using Angular and TensorFlow.js!</h1>
  <h3>
    This game demonstrates the power of combining Angular and TensorFlow.js to
    build highly interactive and reactive applications. To play, we need access
    to your camera as your hand is the controller!
  </h3>

  <h2>How to Play</h2>

  <h3>
    To manage direction, use only 1-hand (preferablly your right) and a single
    digit (thumb or index finger recommended) to point in the direction that you
    want to go.
  </h3>

  <ng-container *ngIf="data?.show">
    <h3>Give it a try by pointing to the right and letâ€™s play!</h3>
